  What is WebRTC?
WebRTC is a free and open source project that enables web browsers and mobile devices to provide simple realtime communication. This means that app features like peer-to-peer video conferencing can easily be integrated into a web page. A browser-based video chat can be engineered rapidly with HTML and JavaScript, no back-end code required.
