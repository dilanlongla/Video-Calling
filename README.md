# What is WebRTC?
WebRTC is a free and open source project that enables web browsers and mobile devices to provide simple realtime communication. This means that app features like peer-to-peer video conferencing can easily be integrated into a web page. A browser-based video chat can be engineered rapidly with HTML and JavaScript, the aewsome part is, no back-end code required.
WebRTC allows users to stream peer-to-peer audio and video in modern web browsers.

Making a userâ€™s device a WebRTC client is as simple as initializing a new RTCPeerConnection(); object in front-end JavaScript. Nowadays, WebRTC support comes out of the box with web browsers like Chrome, FireFox, Edge, Safari, and Opera on desktop, as well as native iOS and Android web browsers.
